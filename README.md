# Webinar Sales Analysis with Python
A project I worked with [Trinly](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trinly-yeoh-6ab0aa208/) when interning at [Learnabee](https://www.linkedin.com/company/learnabee/). We analysed the webinar sales and proposed various action plans needed to boost the sales. Marketing efforts, webinar speakers, and webinar categories are primary factors that affect webinar sales.
